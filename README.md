 Problem Statement
#The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics.The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and     #information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.Extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository through scripting and clone it.Transform the data into a suitable     #format and perform any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval.Create a live geo    #visualization  dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in #the  dashboard.Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display on the dashboard.The solution must be secure, efficient, and #user-friendly.The dashboard must be easily accessible and provide valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe pulse Github repository
     .
     
**Technology Stack Used:**
1.Python.
2.JSON.
3.PostgreSQL.
4.OS.
5.Pandas Library.
6.Streamlit.
7.Plotly Library.
8.image Library.

**Approach:**

1.Data Extraction:

Utilize scripting to clone the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository, fetching the data and storing it in a suitable format like CSV or JSON.

2.Data Transformation:

Use Python scripting, along with Pandas and other libraries, to manipulate and pre-process the data. Tasks may include cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming the data for analysis and visualization.

3.Database Insertion:

Employ the "psycopg2" library in Python to connect to a PostgreSQL database.
Insert the transformed data using SQL commands.

4.Dashboard Creation:

Utilize Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to craft an interactive dashboard. Leverage Plotly's geo map functions for data display, and use Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select various facts and figures.

5.Data Retrieval:

Implement the "psycopg2" library to connect to the PostgreSQL database. Fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe and dynamically update the dashboard with the latest information.

6.Deployment:

Ensure the solution's security, efficiency, and user-friendliness. Thoroughly test the solution before deploying the dashboard publicly, making it easily accessible to users.

7.Comprehensive Approach:

This methodology harnesses the capabilities of Python and its rich library ecosystem to extract, transform, and analyze data. The result is a user-friendly dashboard that visually presents insights derived from the processed data. 
Note: The approach is adjusted for PostgreSQL usage instead of MySQL.

**Results:**

The result of this project will be a live geo visualization dashboard that displays
information and insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository in an interactive
and visually appealing manner. The dashboard will have at least 10 different
dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display. The data
will be stored in a PostgreSQL database for efficient retrieval and the dashboard will be
dynamically updated to reflect the latest data.
Users will be able to access the dashboard from a web browser and easily navigate
the different visualizations and facts and figures displayed. The dashboard will
provide valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe pulse
Github repository, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and decision-making.
Overall, the result of this project will be a comprehensive and user-friendly solution
for extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the Phonepe pulse Github
repository.
